👋 **Hi, I’m @rrconnelly!**
- 👀 I’m interested in using data informatics to better understand and improve social welfare policies. I'm newer to coding, so am excited to be taking a course to learn. 🌱 I have experience using GIS software, and am pumped to be learning more in R.  
- I’m currently learning the basics of R! And how to run nonprofits related to social welfare. I hope to use what I learn to more widely share social welfare and social policy information, and to improve the websites and publications of impactful organizations.  
- 
- 💞️ Grateful for advice and tips, and hopeful everyone out there is navigating the world of COVID and crazy as smoothly as possible.
